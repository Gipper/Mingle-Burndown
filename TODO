refactor:

Move js to separate file in assets. Easier to test/proxy in. Nicer too.
Store the retreived card data needed for the chart in a JSON var (from Ruby side). 
Then read the JSON structure and init the chart in the JS file.

minor:

allow for weekend days to account for offshore schedules
fix the ideal line rounding error
just use full jQuery path and remove noConflict

enhancements:

Look into the historical settings for the hours remaining historical
