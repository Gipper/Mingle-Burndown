refactor:

namespace the js into a nice object with methods. put the whole thing in a closure maybe.
use a class rather than ID to find data and support multiple burndowns on a page.

minor:

allow for weekend days to account for offshore schedules
fix the ideal line rounding error


enhancements:

Look into the historical settings for the hours remaining historical (History API - Card Property)


DONE:

just use full jQuery path and remove noConflict
Move js to separate file in assets. Easier to test/proxy in. Nicer too.
Store the retreived card data needed for the chart in a JSON var (from Ruby side). 
Then read the JSON structure and init the chart in the JS file.
